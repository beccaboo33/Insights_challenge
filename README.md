# Consumer Complaints

## Problem
The federal government provides a way for consumers to file complaints against companies regarding different financial products, such as payment problems with a credit card or debt collection tactics. This challenge will be about identifying the number of complaints filed and how they're spread across different companies. 

**For this challenge, we want to know for each financial product and year, the total number of complaints, number of companies receiving a complaint, and the highest percentage of complaints directed at a single company.


## Output

Each line in the output file lists the following fields in the following order:
* product (name should be written in all lowercase)
* year
* total number of complaints received for that product and year
* total number of companies receiving at least one complaint for that product and year
* highest percentage (rounded to the nearest whole number) of total complaints filed against one company for that product and year. Use standard rounding conventions (i.e., Any percentage between 0.5% and 1%, inclusive, should round to 1% and anything less than 0.5% should round to 0%)
